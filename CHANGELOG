CHANGELOG

0.2.7

    customer.php
	- Fixed bugs relating to adding a customer.
	- Fixed bug for editing customer information.
    a_techs.php
	- Fixed bugs in adding a technician.
    call.inc.php (used to be functions_call.php)
	- Altered the function used to display previous calls so that it displays the correct title in the table
	  (Previous Calls or Call Recap).



0.2.6

2003-03-25
    a_techs.php
	- finished Add Tech and Edit Tech functions
    a_calls.php
	- began converting this file to the new code layout
    connect.php
	- added function for connecting to export database
    status.php
	- added status elements for Add Tech and Edit Tech

2003-03-13
    customer.php
	- fixed Technical Edit form to pass userid with submission so the link to NewCall on the status
	  display works correctly.
	- altered EditForm to pull system specs (system speed, ram) from DB.
    functions_call.php
	- made appropriate changes to deal with calls.dt_start as a timestamp integer instead of a date
	  string
    call.php
	- made appropriate changes to deal with calls.dt_start as a timestamp integer instead of a date
	  string
    DB
	- changed calls.dt_start to an int(11) instead of a varchar(14). the start date/time of a call
	  is now stored as a timestamp instead of as YYYYMMDDHHMMSS

2003-03-01
    header.php
	- bugs with sessions
    functions_call.php
	- added config values to arrays instead of holding the 3 queries open
    DB
	- changed techs.status to techs.access_level in order avoid join issues.
	  joining calls with techs yielded that the status field pointed to
	  techs.status instead of calls.status since they were called the same thing.

2003-02-28
    header.php
	- reworked session management, slimming down the process.
    index.php
	- reworked session management, giving more control to header.php

2003-02-27
    call.php
	- now all aspects of the NewCall form are pulled from the DB (Problem,Verified,Status)
